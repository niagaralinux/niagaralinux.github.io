## This Is Our Story.

Niagara Linux, founded in October of 2020, is focused on implementing better security services for new and existing personal and business IT systems. As we see personal data security and privacy being over-collected as well as misused by Big Tech, and the future trend of smart devices, IoT, and Autopilot popularity brings security risks. We want to help our clients understand and secure their data information through our nearly 20 years of experience in traditional IT companies and Internet companies through the implementation of best practices.
